This article explores the `summary` and `preMMP_results` datasets.
<br>

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(scgElectionsNZ)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Summary
The `summary` dataset contains the overall results at the national-level by Election, Ballot, and Party. It can be used to find the number of seats, votes (n & %), and nominations/on party list by ballot type - Candidate Vote, Party Vote, or Total (Seats column = Candidate + Party; Vote column = Party only). It can also be used to find the number of overhang seats and which party these can be attributed to.

*NB overhang seats occur when the Party Vote entitles that party to fewer seats than the number of electorate seats that it won.*

#### Upload data
View the shape of data frame.
```{r summary}
# Load datasets by using the following helper function:
df <- get_data("summary")
# Alternatively, use: data("summary")
head(df)
```
<br>

#### Explore data subsets
**2023 Party and Candidate Votes:**<br>
This removes the `Total` ballot type from the dataset, leaving just the Party vote and Candidate vote. The data has been further filtered for the most recent election.
```{r summary1}
df %>%
  filter(Ballot != "Total", Election == 2023) %>%
  arrange(-Percentage) %>%
  head(n = 10)
```
<br>

**2023 Overhang Seats**<br>
Filtering to include only the `Total` ballot type and whether the party was successful (i.e., achieved the eligibility requirements), means that you are able to determine where the overhang seats can be attributed to. The data has been further filtered for the most recent election.
```{r summary2}
df %>%
  filter(Successful == "Yes", Ballot == "Total", Election == 2023) %>%
  group_by(Election) %>%
  mutate(`%` = Votes/sum(Votes)*100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Overhang = Seats-round(120*`%`/100,0))
```
<br>

#### Plot
Visualise the number of seats won by party at each election using a stacked bar chart.
```{r summary3, eval = FALSE}
df %>%
  # remove parties which did not win a seat
  filter(Successful == "Yes", Ballot == "Total") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Election, y = Seats,
             fill = factor(Party, levels = c("National Party","ACT Party","NZ First",
                                             "United Future","Jim Anderton's Progressive",
                                             "MANA","Maori Party","Alliance","Green Party",
                                             "Labour Party")))) +

```
```{r SeatsByElection, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/plot_SeatsByElection.png")
```

### preMMP Results
This dataset can be combined with the `preMMP_results` dataset which contains the overall results between 1890 and 1993 by party at the national-level.
<br>
<br>

#### Upload data
View the shape of data frame.
```{r preMMP}
df1 <- get_data("preMMP_results")
head(df)
```
<br>

#### Merge datasets
To match the `preMMP_results` dataset, the `summary` dataset is filtered by the ballot variable to include `Total` only.
```{r preMMP1}
df <- df %>%
  filter(Ballot == "Total") %>%
  mutate(Party = ifelse(Successful == "Yes", Party, "Other")) %>%
  group_by(Election, Party) %>%
  summarise(Seats = sum(Seats), Votes = sum(Votes), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Election) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Votes/sum(Votes)*100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Election, Party, Seats, Percentage)
df2 <- rbind(df, df1)

# view dataset
head(df2)
```
<br>

#### Plot
Visualise the number of party vote at each election using a stacked bar chart.
