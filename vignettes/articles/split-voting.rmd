This article explores the `split_voting` dataset.
<br>

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(scgElectionsNZ)
library(tidyverse)
```
### Split Voting
The `split_total` dataset contains the number of voters who cast their party vote for a different party to their candidate vote at the national level, by party. This dataset only has election years 2005 through to 2023 due to there not being split-ticket voting data available for previous years.
<br>
<br>

#### Upload data
View the shape of data frame.
```{r split-voting}
df <- get_data("split_total")
```
<br>

#### Prepare Sankey
Prepare sankey data.
```{r split-voting1}
df <- df %>%
  filter(Election==2023) %>% # get 2023 election data only
  # combine unsuccessful minor parties into "Other" category
  mutate(List_Party = ifelse(
    List_Party %in% c("Labour Party","ACT Party","Maori Party",
                      "Green Party","National Party","NZ First",
                      "Informal"),
    List_Party, "Other"
  )) %>%
  mutate(Electorate_Party = ifelse(
    Electorate_Party %in%
      c("Labour Party","ACT Party","Maori Party","Green Party",
        "National Party","NZ First","Informal"),
    Electorate_Party, "Other"
  )) %>%
  group_by(List_Party, Electorate_Party) %>%
  summarise(Vote = sum(Votes), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup()

head(df)
```
<br>

#### View colours
Look up colours using the `scgUtils` package and manually enter.
```{r split-voting2}
scgUtils::colour_pal("polNZ")
```
<br>

#### Plot
Again, using the `scgUtils` package, create sankey to visualise the split vote from the candidate vote (left) to the party vote (right).
```{r split-voting3, eval = FALSE}
scgUtils::plot_sankey(
  data = df,
  source = "Electorate_Party", # left side of sankey
  target = "List_Party", # right side of sankey
  value = "Vote",
  colours = '"#ffd006","#45ba52","#d5cdb9","#D82A20","#B2001A","#000000","#00529F","#cdcdd1"',
  fontSize = 20, # reduce font size from default
  width = 1600 # increase width form default
) # %>%
  # save from viewer to html
  # htmlwidgets::saveWidget(file="sankey_2023.html", selfcontained = TRUE)
```
```{r SplitVote, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/plot_SplitVote.png")
```
