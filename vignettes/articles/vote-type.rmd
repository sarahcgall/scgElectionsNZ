This article provides examples of using each the `vote_type` dataset.
<br>

```{r setup, eval = TRUE, include = FALSE}
library(scgElectionsNZ)
library(tidyverse)
```
### Vote Type
The `vote_type` dataset contains the validity of the vote (Disallowed, Informal, and Valid) and the vote type (Ordinary,
Special - NZ, and Special - Overseas) by electorate and ballot type (Candidate and Party).
<br>
<br>
**View percent of disallowed votes by electorate and ballot:**
```{r vote-type1, eval = TRUE}
df <- get_data("vote_type")

df %>%
  filter(Election == 2023) %>%
  group_by(Ballot, Electorate, Validity) %>%
  summarise(Votes = sum(Votes), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Ballot, Electorate) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Votes/sum(Votes)*100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(Validity == "Disallowed") %>%
  arrange(-Percentage) %>%
  head(n = 10)
# ...
```
<br>

**View percentage of voters overseas by electorate:**
```{r vote-type2, eval = TRUE}
df %>%
        # including only valid and informal votes
  filter(Election == 2023, Validity != "Disallowed") %>%
  group_by(Ballot, Electorate, Vote_Type) %>%
  summarise(Votes = sum(Votes), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Ballot, Electorate) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Votes/sum(Votes)*100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(Vote_Type == "Special - Overseas") %>%
  arrange(-Percentage) %>%
  head(n = 10)
```
<br>

**Add a region column to dataset::**
```{r vote-type3}
df <- add_region(df)
df <- df %>%
   # including only valid and informal votes
  filter(Ballot == "Party", Validity != "Disallowed") %>%
  group_by(Election, Region, Vote_Type) %>%
  summarise(Votes = sum(Votes), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Election, Region) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Votes/sum(Votes)*100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(Vote_Type == "Special - Overseas") %>%
  arrange(-Percentage)

df %>%
