This article explores the [`vote_type`](https://sarahcgall.github.io/scgElectionsNZ/reference/vote_type.html) dataset.

### Vote Type
The `vote_type` dataset contains the validity of the vote (Disallowed, Informal, and Valid) and the vote type (Ordinary,
Special - NZ, and Special - Overseas) by electorate and ballot type (Candidate and Party).

<br>

#### Upload data
View the shape of data frame.
```{r vote-type}
df <- get_data("vote_type")
head(df)
```
<br>

**Disallowed votes (%)**<br>
View percent of disallowed votes by electorate and ballot type.
```{r vote-type1}
df %>%
  filter(Election == 2023) %>%
  group_by(Ballot, Electorate, Validity) %>%
  summarise(Votes = sum(Votes), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Ballot, Electorate) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Votes/sum(Votes)*100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(Validity == "Disallowed") %>%
  arrange(-Percentage) %>%
  head(n = 10)
```
<br>

**Overseas votes (%)**<br>
View percentage of voters overseas by electorate.
```{r vote-type2}
df %>%
        # including only valid and informal votes
  filter(Election == 2023, Validity != "Disallowed") %>%
  group_by(Ballot, Electorate, Vote_Type) %>%
  summarise(Votes = sum(Votes), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Ballot, Electorate) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Votes/sum(Votes)*100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(Vote_Type == "Special - Overseas") %>%
  arrange(-Percentage) %>%
  head(n = 10)
```
<br>

#### Add region
Add a column to facet by region.
```{r vote-type3}
df <- add_region(df)
head(df)
```
<br>

#### Plot
Filter by Party vote and exclude disallowed votes from the denominator. Visualise the proportion of votes cast overseas by region at each election.
```{r vote-type4, eval = FALSE}
df <- df %>%
   # including only valid and informal votes
  filter(Ballot == "Party", Validity != "Disallowed") %>%
  group_by(Election, Region, Vote_Type) %>%
  summarise(Votes = sum(Votes), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Election, Region) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Votes/sum(Votes)*100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(Vote_Type == "Special - Overseas") %>%
  arrange(-Percentage)
