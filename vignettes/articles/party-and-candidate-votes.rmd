### Party and Candidate Votes
The `party_votes` and `candidate_votes` datasets contain party and candidate votes, respectively, by electorate and party. Currently, the `party_votes` has all parties listed, including the informal vote, while the `candidate_votes` have only the successful parties listed with the remaining parties listed as "Other". The informal vote is also not included.

Future updates to the `candidate_votes` dataset will replicate the `party_votes` dataset so that the "Other" category is broken down into all parties and the informal vote is included.

```{r party-candidate-votes}
df <- get_data("party_votes")
df1 <- get_data("candidate_votes")

df <- df %>%
  mutate(Party = ifelse(Party %in% c("Labour Party", "National Party", "Green Party",
                                     "ACT Party", "NZ First", "Maori Party"), Party,
                        "Other")) %>%
  group_by(Election, Electorate, Ballot, Party) %>%
  summarise(Votes = sum(Votes), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Election, Electorate, Ballot) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Votes/sum(Votes)*100) %>%
  ungroup()

df2 <- rbind(df, df1)

df2 <- df2 %>%
  filter(Election == 2023) %>%
  mutate(Ballot = ifelse(Ballot == "Party", "Party Vote", "Candidate Vote")) %>%
  select(Election, Ballot, Electorate, Party, Percentage) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Ballot, values_from = Percentage)

df2[is.na(df2)] <- 0

df2 %>%
  filter(Party != "Other") %>%
