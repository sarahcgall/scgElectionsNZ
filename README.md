scgElectionsNZ
================

## Overview

`scgElectionsNZ` is an R package which provides data and functions for
exploring New Zealandâ€™s general election results. All data are from elections occuring between 1996 and 2023, unless stated otherwise.

This package provides the following datasets: 
* `summary`: overall results at the national-level by party
* `turnout`: turnout and informal vote by electorate and ballot type (candidate and party)
* `vote_type`: valdidity and vote type by electorate and ballot type (candidate and party)
* `party_votes`: party vote by electorate and party (electorate-level)
* `candidate_votes`: candidate vote by electorate and party (electorate-level)
* `majority`: winning candidate and margin of victory by electorate (electorate-level)
* `split_total`: split-ticket voting (2005 - 2023 only) - the number of voters who cast their party vote for a different party to their candidate vote (national-level by party)
* `preMMP_results`: overall results between 1890 and 1993 (prior to the introduction of MMP) (national-level by party)
* `historic_turnout`: turnout between 1879 and 2023 (national-level by year)

## Installation

The code below relies on the development version of `scgElectionsNZ`.
Install it with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("sarahcgall/scgElectionsNZ")
```

## Usage
In addition to the datasets listed above, a number of helper functions exist to aid in the analysis of the data. These include:
* `get_data()`: provides ability to save dataset with a name of your choosing.
* `add_region()`: adds a Regions column (e.g., Auckland, Northland, Waikato, etc.) against a dataset containing electorates.
* `add_type()`: adds an Electorate_Type column (i.e., General or Maori) against a dataset containing electorates.
* `update_EName()`: this function converts pre-2020 electorate names to match post-2020 electorate names so that seats can 
be tracked from 1996 until 2023 with one exception of Waipareira which merged with Waitakere in 1999 but then split into Kelston and Upper Harbour.

``` r
# Load datasets by using the following helper function:
df <- get_data("majority")
# Alternatively, use: 
data("majority")

# Add a region column to dataset
df <- add_region(df)

# Add a electorate type column to dataset
df <- add_type(df)

# Convert pre-2020 electorate names to match name changes that occurred in 2020
df <- update_EName(df, column=Electorate)
```

## Dataset Contents
The datasets have been divided into categories based on intended use of the data and contain election data from across 
all elections years for ease of comparison. In addition, all special characters have been removed from the data (e.g., 
M&amacr;ori is now Maori) and party names have been standardised across elections. A full list of amended party names 
can be found in data-raw\utils.R.

The column names within these datasets are uniform for ease of combining multiple datasets together (see table below).

1 Dataset includes Informal Votes under Party column.<br>
2 Ballot includes "Party", "Candidate", or "Total" (Party + Candidate for Seats or Party only for Vote/Percentage).<br>
3 Total refers to the total number of votes cast (Valid + Informal).<br>
4 Candidate column contains the name of the winning candidate for that electorate.<br>
5 Party_List column contains Yes or No values and refers to whether the candidate running in the electorate is also on the Party List.<br> 
6 Nominated column refers to the number of candidates nominated as electorate candidates or the number on a party list depending on Vote_Type.<br>
7 Registered column contains Yes or No values and refers to whether the party is a registered party with a list or an unregistered party without a list.<br>
8 Successful column contains Yes or No values and refers to whether or not a party achieved the 5% Party_Vote threshold or won at least one electorate.<br>

## Examples

#### Summary
The `summary` dataset contains the overall results at the national-level by Election, Ballot,
and Party. It can be used to find the number of seats, votes (n + %), and nominations/on party list by ballot type - 
Candidate Vote, Party Vote, or Total (Seats column = Candidate + Party; Vote column = Party only). It can also be used to
find the number of overhang seats and which party these can be attributed to. 

*NB overhang seats occur when the Party Vote entitles that party to fewer seats than the number of electorate seats that it won.*

by party at the national-level.

#### Turnout
The `turnout` dataset contains the overall turnout and informal vote by electorate and ballot type (Candidate and Party).
It also has the total vote (informal + valid) and total number of electors in the election.

This dataset can be combined with the `historic_turnout` dataset which contains the overall turnout at the 
national-level for all elections between 1879 and 2023. It also contains the total number of MPs in parliament for that 
election, and the total number of electors.

``` r
df <- get_data("turnout")
df1 <- get_data("historic_turnout")
df2 <- left_join(df, df1, by = "Election")

# Compare electorate-level turnout to national-level
df2 <- df2 %>%
  filter(Ballot == "Party", Election == 2023) %>%
  mutate(Turnout = Turnout.x - Turnout.y)

#### Vote Type
The `vote_type` dataset contains the valdidity of the vote (Disallowed, Informal, and Valid) and the vote type (Ordinary, 
Special - NZ, and Special - Overseas) by electorate and ballot type (Candidate and Party).

``` r
df <- get_data("vote_type")

#### Party and Candidate Votes
The `party_votes` and `candidate_votes` datasets contain party and candidate votes, respectively, by electorate and party.
Currently, the `party_votes` has all parties listed, including the informal vote, while the `candidate_votes` have only the 
successful parties listed with the remaining parties listed as "Other". The informal vote is also not included. Future updates
to the `candidate_votes` dataset will replicate the `party_votes` dataset so that the "Other" category is broken down into
all parties and the informal vote is included. 
``` r
df <- get_data("party_votes")
df1 <- get_data("candidate_votes")

df <- df %>%
  mutate(Party = ifelse(Party %in% c("Labour Party", "National Party", "Green Party",

#### Majority
The `majority` dataset contains the winning candidate and the margin of victory by electorate.

``` r

#### Split Voting
The `split_total` dataset contains the number of voters who cast their party vote for a different party to their candidate 
vote at the national level, by party. This dataset only has election years 2005 through to 2023 due to there not being
split-ticket voting data available for previous years.
``` r

## Future Additions and Updates
Additional datasets will include by-election data and the following datasets:
* `results_by_booths`: TBC 
* `split_electorate`: split voting by electorate (2005 - 2023 only)

In future updates, the following functions will be added:
* `amend_boundary`: a function to convert boundaries into current boundaries for a better comparison across multiple elections (this will replace the `update_EName`
function which is ok for general tracking of electorates but not for statistical purposes)
* `plot_parliament`: a function to visualise the number of seats (parliament graph)
* `plot_cartogram`: a function to visualise the vote by electorate (cartogram)

For any suggested additions or amendments, please get in touch!

## Other Packages
* [`scgUtils`](https://github.com/sarahcgall/scgUtils): a package which provides functions and plotting capabilities
