<p>On the 14th of October 2023, New Zealand held their general election.
Overall, 78.2% of voters turned out to vote. The results were officially
declared by the Electoral Commission on the 3rd of November 2023, after
the counting of special votes (votes cast overseas or out of a voter’s
electorate) had taken place.</p>
<p><img src="img/results23_Seats.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>Overall, the centre-right National Party won the most number of seats
(49 including Port Waikato at the subsequent by-election). This was not
enough for the party to govern on its own in the 123 seat parliament
which included 3 overhang seats. As such, the National Party formed a
coalition with the right-wing ACT Party and the populist NZ First Party.
This coalition was formalised on the 24th of November, giving the new
coalition government 68 seats in parliament.</p>
<p><img src="img/results23_Cartogram.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>Of the 72 electorate seats, the National Party dominated, winning 44
seats (61%) - many of which were lost to Labour at the 2020 election. In
the Maori electorates, Te Pati Maori also dominated, winning all but one
seat. Additionally, the Greens and ACT performed well, winning 3 and 2
seats, respectively.</p>
<p><img src="img/results23_CandidateVsParty.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>There was a noticeable difference between the candidate and party
votes. The two major parties performed better in their candidate vote
than their party vote. The reverse was true for minor parties which
performed well in the party vote with ACT, NZ First and Green achieving
either the 5% eligibility threshold.</p>
<p><img src="img/results23_SplitVoting.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>A total of 35.51% of voters split their vote (i.e., cast their
candidate vote for a different party to their party vote). The greatest
split can be seen from the two major parties with a large proportion of
Labour Party voters voting for the Green Party in their party vote and
National Party voters, voting for the ACT Party. NZ First received party
votes from both Labour and National party voters.</p>
<p><img src="img/results_PartyVote.png" width="100%"> Compared with
the previous elections, the 2023 party vote did appear to be similar to
the 1996 general election which also appeared to show a rejection of the
two major parties. In fact, just over 1 in 3 voters voted for a minor
party instead of the two major parties.</p>
<p><img src="img/results_MoV.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>Comparing the candidate vote in each general electorate, the margin
of victory appears to show a swing back towards the 2017 results for the
National Party, recovering what they lost in 2020 from the Labour
Party.</p>
<p><img src="img/results_MoV1.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>Many of Labour’s safe seats however, are now considered marginal and
overall have a lower margin of victory than compared to their 2017
results.</p>
<p><img src="img/results_MoV2.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>Compared with 2020, all but two swing seats went to the National
Party.</p>
<p><img src="img/results_MoV3.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>The bellwether seats of Hamilton West, Maungakiekie, and Otaki all
turned National. (NB In 2017, National had the higher vote share than
Labour. Bellwethers have therefore been selected based on turning
National in 2017 despite Labour forming government).</p>
<p><img src="img/results_MoV4.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>In 2023, the electorates of New Lynn and Mt Roskill turned blue for
the first time in MMP-history. The relatively new electorate of Takanini
also turned blue.</p>
<p><img src="img/results_MoV5.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>National also won back Whangarei, Ilam, and Northland which they lost
in 2020 for the first to Labour. While Nelson had a swing back towards
National, it was not enough to win back the seat in 2023.</p>
<p><img src="img/results_MoV6.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>The number of non-classic seats (i.e., those won not by the two major
parties) increased in 2023. Previously safe Labour seats, Rongotai and
Wellington Central, turned Green for the first time since 1996. The seat
of Tamaki - a previously blue-ribbon seat - turned yellow for the first
time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="pre-election-analysis">Pre-Election Analysis<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pre-election-analysis"></a>
</h2>
<p>The following was an analysis done two months prior to the
election.</p>
<p><img src="img/pre_Cartogram.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>The cartogram shows the Labour Party’s impressive number of general
election gains in 2020 compared with 2017. The party dominated cities
such as Auckland, Wellington, Hamilton, and Christchurch. It also won
seats such as Ilam in the South Island which has been held by the
National Party since 1978.</p>
<p><img src="img/pre_Pendulum.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>The upcoming general election - which will be held on 14 October 2023
- is looking dire for the Labour Party. According to current polling,
the party is set to lose the rare majority that it achieved in 2020.</p>
<p>There is, however, a potential path to victory. If the party can
cauterise the bleeding of party votes before the election, it may still
be able to retain a minority government in coalition with the Green
Party and Te Pati Maori.</p>
<p>For this to occur, Labour can afford to lose no more than 19% of the
party vote if the Greens and Te Pati Maori get at least 15% of the vote,
cumulatively.</p>
<p><img src="img/pre_PartyVote.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>The issue for the National Party is that while Labour is losing a
considerable number of voters, these voters are nor turning to National.
Instead, there appears to be a rejection of the two major parties, with
38% of voters optiong for minor parties instead.</p>
<p>The polling figures are similar to the 1996 election results which
saw neither party achieve a majority and need to rely on a coalition
partner to form government. In the case of the 1996 election, this
partner was NZ First who are currently in a similar position of being
“kingmarker”, sitting on a polling average of 5.8% of the party
vote.</p>
<p>This means that we could be seeing a coalition government, consisting
of the centre-right National Party, right-wing ACT Party, and populist
NZ First Party, come October 14.</p>
